[![deploy](https://github.com/ldgit/work-hours-tracker/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ldgit/work-hours-tracker/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

Track your working hours without sign-ups or sending data to some server.

Features:
- fully client-side: all data is stored locally on user's machine

Planned:
- update status every couple of seconds instead of on refresh
- estimate workday end time based on workday start and current breaks
- create backups your working hours data
